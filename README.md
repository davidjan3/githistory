# Git History

Git History is a tool that allows users to visually explore the commit history of a file in a Git repository. Instead of using terminal commands like `git log` or `git diff`, this tool provides an intuitive and interactive interface to view file changes over time.

## Features 🚀
- 📜 **View File History** – Explore all past versions of a file with a clean and interactive UI.
- 🔍 **Compare File Versions** – Easily view differences between two commits.
- 📅 **Timeline Navigation** – Jump through file versions without running Git commands.
- 🔗 **Seamless GitHub Integration** – View commit history directly in GitHub or use the tool locally in VS Code.

   https://githistory.xyz/user/repo/blob/main/index.js
   ```
3. Press **Enter**, and you'll see an interactive history of that file!

### 2️⃣ VS Code Extension
